# TLV Processor in Java

This project depicts a neat way to deal with TLV requirments.

To add more test cases, add more entries in the inputTest.txt file.

To configure additional operations for the TLV processor, add more entries in TlvTypes enum as well as overriding the performOperation(String string) method of the same to perform the new tasks.
